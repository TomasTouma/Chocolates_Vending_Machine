## üîß Technical Details

### Key Classes & Responsibilities

#### mainScreen.java
- Main customer interface and vending logic
- Coin insertion handling and validation
- Purchase processing with change calculation
- Real-time inventory updates

#### LoginFrame.java
- User authentication system
- Secure access control to admin features
- Input validation and error handling

#### addStockFrame.java
- Inventory management interface
- Stock level adjustments for products and coins
- Synchronized updates with main screen

### Important Methods

#### Purchase Processing (`mainScreen.java`)
- `jButtonTwixActionPerformed()`: Handles Twix purchases
- `jButtonKitKatActionPerformed()`: Handles KitKat purchases
- `jButtonWithdrawActionPerformed()`: Coin return functionality

#### Inventory Management (`addStockFrame.java`)
- `jButton[Product]PlsActionPerformed()`: Increase product stock
- `jButton[Product]MinActionPerformed()`: Decrease product stock
- `jButton[Coin]PlsActionPerformed()`: Increase coin quantities

### Image Resources
The project uses the following images (must be in same package):
- `coinsChange.png` - Change dispensing confirmation
- `twix2.png` - Twix product image
- `kitkat2.png` - KitKat product image
- `mars2.png` - Mars product image
- `kinder2.png` - Kinder product image

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Customization Options
- **Product Prices**: Modify price checks in purchase methods
- **Initial Stock**: Adjust static field initial values
- **Admin Credentials**: Change in `LoginFrame.java` authentication logic
- **Coin Denominations**: Modify coin values in calculation methods

### Security Notes
- Current implementation uses hardcoded credentials
- For production use, consider implementing encrypted credential storage
- Admin interface should have additional access controls

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Images not displaying:**
- Ensure image files are in the same package as Java classes
- Check image file names match the code references
- Verify image paths use forward slashes in package structure

**Purchase not completing:**
- Verify sufficient coins are available for change
- Check product stock levels
- Ensure inserted money meets or exceeds product price

**Admin login failing:**
- Verify username: "admin" (case insensitive)
- Verify password: "admin" (case sensitive)
- Check for extra spaces in input fields

### Error Messages
- "Invalid Username or Password" - Admin authentication failed
- "No coins to withdraw" - Withdrawal attempted with no inserted money
- "Purchase can't be completed" - Insufficient funds or out of stock

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor coin levels to ensure change availability
- Restock popular products regularly
- Check machine money total for collection
- Verify all coin mechanisms are functioning

### Best Practices
- Maintain minimum coin levels for change calculation
- Regular backup of any persistent data (if implemented)
- Keep product prices updated in the code
- Test all coin denominations regularly

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

### Code Structure
- MVC-like architecture with separation of concerns
- Static fields for shared state management
- Event-driven design for user interactions
- Modular methods for maintainability

### Extension Ideas
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Transaction logging and reporting
- Multiple user roles and permissions
- Network connectivity for remote monitoring
- Currency conversion support
